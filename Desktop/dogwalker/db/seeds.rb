# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# dw1 = Dogwalker.create(name: "juan", rating: 10)
# dw2 = Dogwalker.create(name: "keenan", rating: 5)
# dw3 = Dogwalker.create(name: "cesar", rating: 1)
